==== Implement the entity classes

The class wizard has already created a file and the empty class "Task". We will
manually enhance this class as follows:

[source,javascript]
----
export abstract class Task {  //  <1>
  public id: string?;
  public label: string?;
}
----

<1> In the first line of code, we have defined an *abstract class* named Task. Classes in
N4JS are similar to classes in ECMAScript 2015 or Java. The concept of an abstract
class is borrowed from Java. This means that we cannot have a _direct instance_
of Task in our model, but we may have _subclasses_ of Task.
