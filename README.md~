# redesigned-octo-meme
A Python Thingus.

# Why are you Octomeming?
Brian and India would like to learn Python and thought this would be a good idea.

Things to think about:
* A simple purpose for the code.
* Small description of the repo.
* Some setup instructions for GitHub (GitHub Desktop/command line use).
* Some general branching concepts (pull requests).
* Octomemes.


#Code editor?
Whats a good choice? As per Shane's suggestion, we (India and I) should just use Sublime. It's probbaly the most useful, in general.

* Sublime Text? https://www.sublimetext.com/ (I think this is a good one, as you can switch syntax highlighting between different languages etc)

#Getting Started on an OctoMeme - Gotta Get git  

(is git usually installed on OSX or do you need to download XCode or something?) 
To check if git is installed, you can run the "git" command in the terminal and check the results.

*One easy way to install git is to install the desktop app - [github desktop - https://desktop.github.com/ ]
once installed, open it and in the preferences panel, check “install command line tools”

In this way, you can use the Desktop app with a nice GUI to visualise changes and also use command-line tools for some more fine-grained control over branches etc.


#Clone the shit

If you go to the Redesigned Octo Meme repo on GitHub.com [ https://github.com/Eutechnik/redesigned-octo-meme ] you will find the URL of the .git so you can clone the repository and start working on a branch. This file is [ https://github.com/Eutechnik/redesigned-octo-meme.git ]
