A Python Thingus.

# Why are you Octomeming?
Brian and India would like to learn Python and thought this would be a good idea.

#The story so far:
Myself and India have some repos cloned, beginning on some tutorials

#Python editors?
Whats a good choice? As per Shane's suggestion, we (India and I) should just use Sublime. It's probbaly the most useful, in general.

* Sublime Text? https://www.sublimetext.com/ (I think this is a good one, as you can switch syntax highlighting between different languages etc)

I woz 'ere !
