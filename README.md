A Python Thingus.

# Why are you Octomeming?
Brian and India would like to learn Python and thought this would be a good idea.

Things to think about:
* A simple purpose for the code.
* Some general branching concepts (pull requests).
* Octomemes.

#The story so far:
Myself and India have some repos cloned, beginning on some tutorials
