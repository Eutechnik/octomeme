# redesigned-octo-meme
A Python Thingus.

# Why are you Octomeming?
Brian and India would like to learn Python and thought this would be a good idea.

Things to think about:
* A simple purpose for the code.
* Small description of the repo.
* Some setup instructions for GitHub (GitHub Desktop/command line use).
* Some general branching concepts (pull requests).
* Octomemes.


#Python editors?
Whats a good choice?

* Sublime Text? https://www.sublimetext.com/ (I think this is a good one, as you can switch syntax highlighting between different languages etc)
* http://www.wxpython.org/ ?
* http://www.pygtk.org/ ?
* Just use sublime. Don't bother with the others.
