A Python Thingus.

# Why are you Octomeming?.
Brian and India would like to learn Python and thought this would be a good idea.

Things to think about:
* A simple purpose for the code.
* Small description of the repo.
* Some setup instructions for GitHub (GitHub Desktop/command line use).
* Some general branching concepts (pull requests).
* Octomemes.
